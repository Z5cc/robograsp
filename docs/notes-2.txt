do inverse kinematics, because then robot does not need to learn inverse kinematics. use delta instead of absolute, because 


do it all in two steps:


1.
observation space:
only vision [no current position, because of mechanical inaccuracies]

action space:
a_t e   [delta_pos[for now only x_y_z],close or open the gripper] 


2.
observation space:
vision + torque sensor

action space:
more granular











Reinforcement learning:

step 1:
find out how the two environments work

step 2:
find out how to train them with PPO etc... also try to find out how PPO etc... works...





probably robot not learning sufficiently is because da and dz are mixed when sending to kuka.apply action...





f = 0.3
realAction = [dx, dy, -0.002, da, f]
