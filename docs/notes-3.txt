TODO:
- improve codebase: more OOP, more modular + include PPO and compare performance
- somehow make the problem simpler (only one cube), multiple object is only relvevant for vision-only reach-phase
- implement two phases:
    - a) input: vision          output: position 
    - b)
        - control point of view:    torque_wanted (voltage_wanted) - torque_measured (voltage_measured)        ->          torque_input (voltage_input)
        - AI:   hierarchical reinforcement learning etc...
